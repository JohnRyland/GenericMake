# Description:
#
#  Simple boilerplate of a makefile where what you need to provide is TARGET,
#  SOURCES and CFLAGS. Included file dependancies are automatically calculated
#  I have a more complex version of this which handles sub-directories and
#  sub-projects, but this is the most basic version which is reasonably
#  self-explainetary.
#
# Example usage:
#
#  TARGET = MyApp
#  SOURCES = myapp.cpp classA.cpp classB.cpp
#  CFLAGS = -I.
#  -include Simple.mak
#
